This is a simple pong game created by Dennis J. McWherter, Jr.
with the SDL library. In order to run this program, you may have
to copy your own SDL source "include" directory to the "SDL" 
after running "./configure" for your system's specific SDL 
configuration.

The included SDL header files are from MSVC 10.

I have included the archived package of the version libSDL used
 within this distribution - if you need to recompile, or
reconfigure the header files, you can simply extract this archive
and proceed accordingly.
