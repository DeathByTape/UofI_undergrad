To implement PGPS, I first solved the problem for GPS. Then, with these
results, I calculated which packet to send next based on who should finish
first in the theoretical GPS scenario.
It is important to note that the calcuation was based on a simulated value.
I made calculations based on what the simulator thought was the next
event (accounting for arrivals appropriately).
