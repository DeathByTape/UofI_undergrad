Design Notes:

This is a decentralized failure detection system. Do not be mislead by the notion of "Client" and "Server."
If these words confuse your notion of decentralized system, replace them with "Receiver" and "Sender" respectively.
Each machine in the network is composed of both a server and client component. The "Server" sends out all the 
messages to a connected peer. The client receives messages from its connected peer. The "Client" never sends messages
and the "Server" component never receives messages. A visual model is given below


--> Denotes message sent in this direction (i.e. the receiving machine waits for this message)

Top-level:

                     / -->[ Machine 1 ]--\
                    /                     \
                   /                       \
            [ Machine 2]                    --> [ Machine 3 ]
                ^                                     |
                |-------------------------------------|


Detailed look:
                            [ Machine 1 ]
                 ---------->[  Client   ]
                /           [  Server   ]-- 
               /                            \
[ Machine 2 ] /                              \        [ Machine 2 ]
[ Server    ]/                                \------>[ Client    ]
[ Client    ]                                         [ Server    ]
     ^                                                     |
     |-----------------------------------------------------|
